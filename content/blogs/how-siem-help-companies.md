**Understanding the Role of SIEM in Compliance with Security and Privacy Laws**

Data privacy and security are evergreen concerns for cybersecurity professionals, especially after the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks. Businesses of all sizes are now taking more diligence in addressing such issues. This blog will cover the following topics:

- Famous privacy and security laws and the reason for their existence
- GDPR
- CCPA

**Famous Privacy and Security Laws and the Reason for Their Existence**

Cyber threats are not new, and there are many ways that cyber hackers try to infiltrate digital personal spaces and steal data. Some common methods include phishing and opening backdoors. With the growth of the World Wide Web and the incorporation of new digital architectures, such security breaches have become more prominent, larger, and vulnerable. As organizations become more dependent on digital systems, they are even more vulnerable to hacks.

The growing demand for big data has led organizations to collect more customer data to serve them better, but this also increases the risk of security breaches and privacy issues. In response, governments around the world are taking more measures to protect the rights of their citizens by passing privacy and security laws.

For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets a precedent for levying heavy fines on organizations that violate privacy and security laws. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives California consumers more control over the sharing of their personal information.

**GDPR**
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the EU's stance on privacy and security law. It gives individuals more control over their personal information and holds organizations accountable for protecting that information.

**CCPA**
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is the US's stance on privacy and security law. It applies to for-profit businesses with a gross annual revenue of more than $25 million and gives consumers more control over the sharing of their personal information.

**Emerging Trends in Security Laws and Privacy Concerns Around the World**
In response to the growing need for privacy and security, various countries have started to work on their digital national security by protecting their resident's personal information. For example, Brazil has a local framework that addresses specific issues that are different from GDPR, considering the local dynamics and impact of emerging technologies.

**Role of SIEM**
As organizations are busy managing their businesses, they may not have the time to address all security and privacy concerns. This is where exploit hunters offer SIEM (security information and event management) support to put things on automation. SIEM is powered with the latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence and is built on top of the Elastic stack to combat severe security issues in advance.
