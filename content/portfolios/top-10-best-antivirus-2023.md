Antivirus software is designed to protect your computer from a range of threats, including hackers and malware. Here are some ways antivirus software can help mitigate these threats:

Real-time scanning: Antivirus software continuously monitors your computer's files and processes for suspicious activity. If it detects any malware or hacking attempts, it will alert you and take steps to remove or neutralize the threat.

Malware detection: Antivirus software uses a variety of techniques to identify and detect malware, including signature-based scanning, behavior-based detection, and heuristics. This enables the software to detect and remove a wide range of malware, including viruses, trojans, worms, and spyware.

Firewall protection: Many antivirus software products also include a firewall, which can help protect your computer from unauthorized access by hackers. The firewall monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and can block suspicious activity to prevent hackers from gaining access to your computer.

Phishing protection: Some antivirus software includes phishing protection features, which can help protect you from phishing scams. These features typically analyze web pages and email messages for suspicious links or content and can block access to known phishing sites.

Automatic updates: Antivirus software vendors regularly update their products to ensure they stay ahead of the latest threats. By keeping your antivirus software up to date, you can help ensure that your computer is protected against the latest malware and hacking attempts.

Overall, antivirus software can play a crucial role in mitigating the risk of hackers and malware. By using a reliable antivirus product and keeping it up to date, you can help protect your computer and your data from a range of cyber threats. However, it's important to remember that antivirus software is just one part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. Other measures, such as keeping your operating system and other software up to date, using strong passwords, and avoiding risky online behavior, are also essential for protecting yourself against cyber threats.
